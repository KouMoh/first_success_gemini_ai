They are, unfortunately, also bad for the environment. They are not only polluting the seas and land, but also contributing to climate change and air emissions.1Overview2Key facts3EU actionPlastic is a relatively new invention in human history with some of the first examples dating back to the late 1800s, but its versatility and low production cost have made it one of the most widely used materials of modern times. In western Europe, the average annual plastic consumption is around 150kg per person — more than twice the global average of 60kg. \\rGlobal consumption of plastic is accelerating. Over half of the plastic production ever manufactured has been produced since 2000  and we are set so double our current global annual production by 2050. Only about an estimated 9% of the plastics ever produced have been recycled and 12% have been incinerated. The remainder is either still in use or has either been disposed of in landfills or released into the environment, including the oceans. \\rA report by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation showed that if we do not act on the plastic problem, there will be more plastic by mass than fish in the oceans by 2050.\\rThe durability of plastics means that discarded items remain in the environment for generations. Environmental impacts from discarded plastics include littering, leaching of toxic components, and the contamination of ecosystems and the food chain with microplastics — which can end up eventually in humans with unknown health effects.\\rBesides polluting the environment, plastic production contributes to climate change: annual emissions related to plastic production in the EU amount to around 13.4 million tonnes of CO2, or about 20% of the chemicals industry’s emissions in the European Union. In Europe, plastic is used mostly (about 74%) for non-packaging purposes, like in construction, furniture, textiles and consumer electronics. \\rIn the 1950s,  global production of plastic was about two million tons. In 2020, it was around 450 million tons. 85% of marine litter from land-based sources is plastic. This is a big problem because of plastic’s impact on marine life and human health via the food chain. Ingestion of plastics by marine species is widespread in European seas. For example, 93% of fulmar birds assessed in the North-East Atlantic Ocean had ingested some plastic and 85% of turtles assessed in the Mediterranean Sea had ingested litter.\\rAbout 8% of European microplastics released to oceans are from synthetic textiles — globally, this figure is estimated at 16-35%. Between 200,000 and 500,000 tonnes of microplastics from textiles enter the global marine environment each year.\\rPlastic production in Europe alone amounted to 57.2 Mt in 2021.Post-consumer recycled plastics and bio-based/bio-attributed plastics respectively accounted for 10.1% and 2.3% of the European plastics production, according to Plastics Europe. The EU is taking action to tackle plastic pollution and marine litter and to accelerate the transition to a circular and resource-efficient plastics economy. Specific rules, targets and guidelines apply to certain areas, including single-use plastics, plastic packaging, microplastics, and bio-based, biodegradable and compostable plastics.\\rThe EU’s plastics strategy, as part of the circular economy action plan, outlines specific actions in more detail.\\rHowever, estimates show that a significant fraction of Europe’s total plastic consumption — non-packaging plastics — is somewhat outside this policy focus and at risk of being overlooked in Europe’s transformation towards a more circular economy. \\rEU’s Zero Pollution Action Plan includes, as one of its main targets, reducing plastic litter at sea (by 50%) and microplastics released into the environment (by 30%).

The Circularity Metrics Lab complements other circularity monitoring frameworks by presenting ‘additional’ evidence on circularity.The CML plastics module provides metrics that do not necessarily have the benefits of broad geographical coverage or long time series and provide room for more ‘experimental’ data sources.A key purpose for CML plastics is to present a diverse group of metrics to reveal the status and trends for the circular plastics economy in Europe.

This is a big problem because of plastic’s impact on marine life and human health via the food chain. The persistent nature of plastic means that it can last up to 500 years in some cases.\\xa0Plastic packaging and small plastic items comprise nearly 80% of plastic waste and are a common sight on European beaches. Although the amount of waste continues to increase, current waste management capacity is limited.
